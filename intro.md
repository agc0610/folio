Paul Adams, an SVP at Intercom, called out in a blog post how portfolios are really a chance for the viewer to see how someone **identifies** and **solves** problems. Often, though, they become like art galleries, visually delightful with meaning left to the viewer to interpret. 

My goal is for you to get acquainted with how I have handled **three (3) example scenarios** as a senior/lead with increased abstraction and broader-range complexity. If you would like to have me walk you through artefacts, I am happy to do so in a live session to honour NDAs from past work. 

Looking forward to speaking with you. :) 


### Case 1, Tech and Consulting: "We want to take design and SaaS seriously so we're creating a new division. We want you to lead UX and Product." 

#### What I heard
We are taking design seriously but don't know where to start. Where do we start? 

#### The problem I named
There is a need for basic signposts and standards of good performance in the business. 

#### The real problem I discovered after a few weeks on the job: 
[Although the executive level and the software team took design seriously, no one else did yet. Nor did anyone fully understand that SaaS is a business model choice that requires a lot of investment and a stomach for long-term gambling.] 

#### My approach: 
This was arguably the most abstract design role I have held, so I did some more background learning on managing and systems first.  

1. I spent time consulting sources like Julie Zhuo's *The Making of a Manager* and Donella Meadows' *Thinking in Systems: A Primer* which an old friend had recommended in his Engineering Management blog.  

2. When I arrived, I asked for all documentation on design and product, and created an inventory of all tools and processes currently in use or being considered. I scheduled time with everyone on the team 1 on 1 to ask them about their role. I wanted to get their own words and perspectives on what they did every day and what they thought they were working toward.  

3. I checked the skills and capacity we had against an "ideal" agile software team to look for holes or mismatches of skill against responsibilities in the existing team. Over time I sorted out product from design, and product/design from development. I wrote new job descriptions, co-created a rough design system, and collaborated with the Engineering Lead to hire another Front End Developer.   

4. While doing that, I did an evaluation of our toolkit and updated tools we could use to increase transparency, collaboration, and cost savings. 

	* We switched to Monday.com, which made it easier for sales, marketing and product to communicate. It also doubled as a great project management tool while we experimented with sprints versus shape up cycles. 
	* Figma became the mockup tool of choice because of its collaboration feature, and its integration into our build cycles. 
	* I also re-introduced rapid paper prototypes as a first-response strategy before spending time on mockups so we could test new ideas without spending any money. 

#### The outcome: 
While there is still a ways to go, there are clear design and product performance standards for review cycles and quarterly goals and the design and product team are much more data-driven on everything from "is this the right tool for us?" to "Does this best balance customer needs and the business' strategy?" The culture of usability testing and prototyping is much stronger as well. Getting and keeping buy-in was fuelled by creating data-driven wins for others to see concretely the impact of good design.  

### Case 2, Banking: "We decided we are going to build this new product. Who is our best user? What is the ideal experience?" 

#### What I heard: 
"We might not have done the research we should have to decide if this was even a good idea before we got the green light from leadership. Here we go anyway so let's make it work!" 

#### The problem I named: 
We need to find a way to distinguish our user experience design for this product so that it's worth making the switch away from beloved competitors.  

#### My approach:  
1. Whether internal or external, always have a kickoff meeting. It aligns expectations and gets questions on the table. I usually use this time to get context as well and identify owners versus those accountable or responsible for different parts.
  
2. As a designer, I also try to talk with stakeholders one on one to ask them, "What is your understanding of the problem this solution addresses? What is an ideal outcome for you?" This helps me ensure that any design choices are balanced with the business requirements.   

3. In this case, I worked with stakeholders to form hypotheses on best users. I designed interview questions to uncover potential areas we could create a competitive edge, and then wrote a survey to substantiate our findings. 

#### The outcome: 
Based on this work, my company was able to continue working on this project for another two years. My colleagues subsequently did mockups and usability testing and carried the project forward. I was reassigned to another project with difficult stakeholders, but still advised on usability testing and conducted design critiques. 

### Case 3, Telco: "We are doing IoT and this is inherently cool. Help us design the admin dashboard but also we are not sure yet who our target admin should be."

#### What I heard: 
"We have never designed this type of experience before. What are our customers doing and would they go for this idea?"

#### The problem I named: 
We are actually not aware of all our blind spots, so we need to set up a customer journey to check if we've missed anything before taking this out of the MVP stage. 

#### My approach: 
1. In this case, I had missed the kickoff but needed to provide support to the more UI-oriented design team member who was trying to create visuals based on client input but had not done the research yet to understand the end user's needs. 

2. I designed and administered a series of interviews to five types of "cast members" in the market ecosystem, and then I wrote and administered a survey to substantiate my findings. 

3. The customer journey that we fleshed out was more complex than originally assumed: we actually had two journeys, depending on the type of customer initiating the relationship with the Telco. We also had to manage competing market segments and potential corresponding product strategies depending on how the Telco wanted to proceed (namely, vertical integration? Horizontal universal applicability?) 

#### The outcome: 
This resulted in a customer journey visual with introductions to customer "cast member" archetypes, market segments and the corresponding strategies, along with highlighted caveats and tradeoffs. This allowed us to focus the UI work on a single, most viable MVP.
